    "It works by incorporating number of biological factors such as gene expression, types of interactions, and gene positions in a pathway to the structure and dynamics of the pathway. Further, it modeles the pathway as a graph, where nodes represent genes and edges represent interactions between them. Most importantly it models gene expression as a linear function of other genes in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "it differs from NetGSA for the fact that  it doesn't impose any constraints on the structure of a pathway. On the contrary NetGSA accounts for a gene's baseline expression by representing it as a latent variable in the model and it requires the pathways to be represented as a dircted acyclic graphs."

Hence currently available tools for pathway analysis uses very limited knowledge for mapping the input, which authors mentioned as low resolution in knowledge bases."
